        The business model of this service is an aggregator that brings together commercial and noncommercial organizations and charges
        a commission for transactions. The percentage that goes to the account of the platform owner is discussed individually with each company.
        The platform also has a subscription system. It allows nonprofits to post more than one project for which they collect donations.
